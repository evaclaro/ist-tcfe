\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}


The Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit described in Figure~\ref{fig:circuito}.

In this simulation is important to explain the creation of an auxiliary voltage $V_b$ (with a voltage equal to $0V$) that was put between N6 and R7 as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:malhaC}. Consequently, this led to the appearance of a node that we designated by N8 that has the same voltage as N6.

This was necessary because of Ngspice software requirements.

By observing the Table~\ref{tab:op},Table~\ref{tab:nodal} and Table~\ref{tab:mesh} that the simulated results are the same as the theoretical results.%s√£o mesmo mesmo iguais?

However, was also calculated the relative errors made in order to understand the accuracy of the results. The results of this procedure are presented in Table~\ref{tab:erros}
