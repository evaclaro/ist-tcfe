% state the learning objective 

This report is being made for the subject of Circuit Theory and Electronics Fundamentals and is related to the $1^st$ laboratory.

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing 7 resistors, 1 voltage source, 1 current source, 1 current controlled voltage source and 1 voltage controlled current source.

The display of this circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:circuito}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis} we will analise theorically the circuit and present the results obtained by Octave.

Secondly, in Section~\ref{sec:simulation} we will simulate the circuit using ngspice, present the results obtained and compare them with the ones gathered from Section~\ref{sec:analysis}.

The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
