\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


The objective of this laboratory assignment is to analyse the circuit and solve it. After discussing with all members of the group we can conclude that this goal was achieved.
As presented the results obtained by the Octave math tool and Ngspice simulation tool are the same. This perfect match was achieved because the circuit is only composed of linear components so both models (Ngspice and Octave) used the same methods to solve the circuit and therefore the results can not differ.
Also, all the components used in this circuit (resistors, branches, nodes,...) are perfect this means they don't dissipate energy by heating.
Finally, this similarity proves the efficiency and importance of the nodal and mesh methods.
