\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


The objective of this laboratory assignment is to analise the circuit and solve it. After discussing with all members of the group we can conclude that this goal was achieved.
As presented the results obtained by the Octave math toll and Ngspice simulation tool are the same. This perfect match was achieved because the circuit is only composed by linear components so both models (Ngspice and Octave) used the same methos to solve the circuit and therefore the results can not differ.
Also all the components used in this circuit (resistors, branches, nodes,...) are perfect this means they don't dissipate energy by heating.
Finally this similaraty proves the efficency and importance of the nodes and mesh methods.
