\hspace{0,5cm} The aim of this laboratory assignment was to develop a Bandpass Filter using an OP-Amp and it was achieved. 

\par By comparing the analysis and simulation results side by side, there is a slight difference between the two, which means that the results aren't equal and exactly the same in NGSpice and Octave. 
\par Although, we believe that the differences are not that significant and they can be explained by how NGSpice solves the circuit compared to how it was done in the theoretical analysis, considering that NGSpice uses a model with more parameters for the Operational Amplifier that Octave this can be the main reason for the differences. 
\par Concerning this fact, the results obtained are reasonables and it was a sucessful analysis of the circuit.
\par Nevertheless, the results were achieved not having the best merit possible. The merit of the circuit was obtained by trial and error, a method that is not perfect and does not result in the best possible results. In this way, we concluded that in order to obtain good results, we were obliged to "yield" part of the merit.
\par The merit obtained was $1.59048 \times 10^{-06}$, with a cost of $13426.8$ MU.
