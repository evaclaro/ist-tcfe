\hspace{0,5cm} The objective of this laboratory assignment was to develop a Bandpass Filter and the main goal was achieved. 

\par However by observing analysis and simulation results side by side it can be seen a difference between the two, the results aren't equal and exactly the same comparing both NGSpice and Octave. 
\par Although, we believe that the differences are not that significant and they can be explained by how NGSpice solves the circuit compared to how it was done in the theoretical analysis, considering that NGSpice uses a model with more parameters for the Operational Amplifier that Octave this can be the main reason for the differences. 
\par Regarding this fact, the results obtained are reasonables and it was  a sucessful analysis of the circuit.
\par Nevertheless the results were achieved not having the best merit. The merit of the circuit was obtained by trial and error, a method that is not perfect and does not result in the best possible results. In this way, we concluded that in order to obtain good results, we were obliged to "yield" part of the merit.
\par This way, the objective should have never been to have equal results, but rather, have results that seemed reasonables, which we believe it was achieved. The merit obtained was xxx, with a cost of xxxxx.
