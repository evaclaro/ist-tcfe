\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


The objective of this laboratory assignment is to analyse the circuit and solve it. After discussing with all members of the group we can conclude that this goal was achieved.

As presented the results obtained by the Octave math tool and Ngspice simulation tool are the same. This perfect match was achieved in all the analysis done (operationg, transient and frequency) as presented in Section~\ref{sec:comparison}.

Also, all the components used in this circuit (resistors, branches, nodes,...) are perfect this means they don't dissipate energy by heating.This is one of the advantages of simulating rather than doing it on the laboratory, the other one being the elimination of "humam error". It's known that this type of error can influence the experimental results causing considerable relative errors, which in our case weren't made.

Finally, this similarity proves the efficiency and precision of the methods that were used.
