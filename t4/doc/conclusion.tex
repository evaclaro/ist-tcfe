\hspace{0,5cm} The objective of this laboratory assignment was to develop an audio amplifier circuit and the main goal was achieved. 

\par However by observing analysis and simulation results side by side it can be seen a difference between the two, the results arenÂ´t equal and exactly the same comparing both NGSpice and Octave. 
\par Although, we believe that the differences are not that significant and they can be explained by how NGSpice solves the circuit compared to how it was done in the theoretical analysis, processes that were also explanied on our lectures. To solve this non-linear circuit, NGSpice used far more advanced simulation methods, with many more parameters, while Octave used an approximated model an incremental analysis. 
\par Regarding this fact and despite the differences, the theoretical model provides good results and can be used when there is no simulation tools to use or to quickly confirmed the simulation results obtained.

\par Nevertheless it was achieved not having the best merit. The merit of the circuit was obtained by trial and error, a method that is not perfect and does not result in the best possible results. In this way, we concluded that in order to obtain good results, we were obliged to "yield" part of the merit.

\par The error obtained between the average theoretical value and average simulated value is xxxx\% which wouldn't be signficant in a real life cenario but for a online simulation is a bit significant.

\par This way, the objective should have never been to have equal results, but rather, have results that seemed reasonables, which we believe it was achieved. The merit obtained was xxxxx, with a cost of xxxxxxx.
