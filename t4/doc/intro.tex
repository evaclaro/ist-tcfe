\hspace{0,5cm} This report is being made for the subject of Circuit Theory and Electronics Fundamentals and is related to the forth laboratory being its objective to develop an audio amplifier circuit by choosing the architecture ot the Gain and Output amplifier stages.
The circuit is shown in \ref{}.
In Section~\ref{sec:analysis} a theoretical analysis will be made. Secondly, in Section~\ref{sec:simulation} it will be simulated the circuit using ngspice. Following with both results from Section~\ref{sec:analysis} and Section~\ref{sec:simulation} being compared and commented in Section ~\ref{sec:comparison}
\par The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
\par Finally, it is important to notice tha was developed an algoritm to find...??
