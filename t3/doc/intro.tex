% state the learning objective 

\hspace{0,5cm} This report is being made for the subject of Circuit Theory and Electronics Fundamentals and is related to the third laboratory being its objective to develop an AC/DC converter circuit using a envelope detector and a voltage regulator. The display of this circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:circuito}.
In Section~\ref{sec:analysis} a theoretical analysis will be made. Secondly, in Section~\ref{sec:simulation} it will be simulated the circuit using ngspice. Following with both results from Section~\ref{sec:analysis} and Section~\ref{sec:simulation} being compared and commented in Section ~\ref{sec:comparison}
\par The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
